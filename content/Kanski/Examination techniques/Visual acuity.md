Think of VA as a mountain: the top at the fovea, declining towards periphery.
 
In the dark: this hill flattens: as the peripheral retina has more rods that are more sensitive to light.
 
Perimetry: tests the visual field -> REMEMBER: it is ==subjective==
 
HFA: uses algorithm for shorter testing time (SITA) based on normal and glaucomatous fields.  
Reliability indices: above 15% false is regarded significant.

- False positives: a sound is played, but no light shown -> patient presses
- False negatives: if brighter light at already-tested location evokes no response
    
    - Inattention, tiredness, kwade wil.    

Central testing (e.g. for glaucoma):  
HFA 30-2

- 30: degrees tested on the temporal side (counted from the fovea)
- 2: describes the pattern of the points tested

HFA 10-2

- More detailed central (10 degrees) information
- Especially useful for advanced glaucoma
