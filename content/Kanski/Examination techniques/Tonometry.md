Goldmann tonometry
 
Imbert-Fick principle: pressure (P) inside the sphere equals force needed to flatten ï¿¼the sphere (F) divided by the flattened surface (A).
 
The measured IOP is proportional to the pressure applied to the cornea (or elsewhere) and the thickness of the cornea (or elsewhere)
 
The eye is not an ideal sphere and resists force (rigid cornea).  
The capillairy attraction of the tear film attracts objects towards the cornea.  
At a surface diameter of ==3.06mm== these forces cancel each other -> correct alignment of Goldmann probe (right image below)

If the spires are too thick (too much stain): overestimation of IOP  
If the spires are too thin: very hard to position inner sides (underestimation of IOP)
 
Remember:
- [[Goldmann]] assumes central corneal thickness of 520 micron
- Thinner cornea: underestimation of IOP
    - Normal tension glaucoma
    - After refractive surgery
- Thicker cornea: overestimation
    - Ocular hypertension
- Corneal edema: underestimation of IOP (less rigid cornea)
- Astigmatism > 3dpt
- Repeated measurements in short time will drop IOP

Deceleration of ball is proportional to [[Intra-oculaire druk - IOP]].
