**Direct illumination**: small beam for cornea
 
**Scleral scatter**: light on the limbus, microscope centrally  
Light is transmitted within the cornea stroma -> good to asses subtle stromal haze, or cellular / lipid infiltrates.
 
**Retroillumination**: in mydriasis light reflects back from fundus or iris-> fine epithelial or endothelial corneal changes:
- Epithelial cysts, keratitic precipitates, small blood vessels.
 
**Direct ophthalmoscope**: can be used bedside, x15 magnification, but no stereoscope and small field of vision.
 
**Slit lamp biomicroscopy**:  
Do not use contact lens if:
- Corneal trauma, infection, or hyphema (bloed in VOK)

Indirect technique:
- Slit beam width: 1/4th
- Illumination coaxial with viewing
- Magnification and light intensity to lowest setting
