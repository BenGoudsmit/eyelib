AR disorder in which decreased enzymatic metabolism of the amino acid methionine results in systemic accumulation of methionine and homocysteine.
- Systemic features include coarse blond hair, blue irises, malar flush, Marfanoid habitus, neurodevelopmental delay, marked thrombotic predisposition and early atherosclerosis
- Treatment involves oral pyridoxine, folic acid and vitamin B12 to reduce plasma homocysteine and methionine levels.
- [[Ectopia lentis]], typically inferonasal, is almost universal by the age of 25 years in untreated cases. The zonules, which normally contains high levels of cysteine (deficient in homocystinuria), disintegrate so that accommodation is often lost. Pupillary block may occur.
- Other ocular features include iris atrophy, optic atrophy, cataract, myopia and retinal detachment.
